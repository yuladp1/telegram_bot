# TechDigestBotR ðŸ¤–

A Telegram bot that automatically collects and publishes the latest technology news to the [TechDigestBotR](https://t.me/TechDigestBotR) channel.

## Features

- Aggregates news from selected technology sources:
  - TechCrunch
  - The Verge
  - Ars Technica
- Uses a local SQLite database to prevent posting duplicate news
- Processes RSS feeds and selects only the most recent unpublished articles
- Publishes clean article titles and descriptions without promotional inserts
- Runs automatically on a defined schedule via **GitHub Actions**:
  - Weekdays â€” morning and evening
  - Weekends â€” midday

## How It Works

1. **News Parsing** â€” The bot fetches the latest articles from predefined RSS feeds.
2. **Duplicate Check** â€” Each article is compared with stored entries in the SQLite database to ensure it is not reposted.
3. **Publishing** â€” If the article is new, it is posted to the Telegram channel.

## Running the Bot

### Local Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuladp1/telegram_bot.git
